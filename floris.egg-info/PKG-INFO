Description: 
        FLORIS
        ------
        The ``develop`` branch of the FLORIS repo represents a rework of the software as a general wind farm wake analysis tool.
        
        For questions regarding FLORIS, please contact `Jen Annoni <mailto:jennifer.annoni@nrel.gov>`_, `Paul Fleming <mailto:paul.fleming@nrel.gov>`_, or `Rafael Mudafort <mailto:rafael.mudafort@nrel.gov>`_.
        
        **NOTE: This FLORIS repository is under active development. Be aware that the implementation is not yet validated or verified.**
        
        Background and objectives
        =========================
        Coming soon.
        
        Architecture
        ============
        An architecture diagram as in input to `draw.io <https://www.draw.io>`_ is contained in the repository at ``FLORIS/florisarch.xml``.
        
        Generally, a user will not have to write Python code in order to express a wind farm, turbine, or wake model combination. Currently, 
        an example wake model, turbine, and wind farm is expressed in ``examples/floris.json``.
        
        Download
        ========
        FLORIS can be cloned directly from GitHub: ``git clone https://github.com/wisdem/floris``
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        The following packages are required for FLORIS
        
        - Python3
        
        - NumPy v1.12.1
        
        - SciPy v0.19.1
        
        - matplotlib v2.1.0
        
        
        After installing Python3, the remaining dependencies can be installed with ``pip`` referencing the requirements list using this command:
        
        ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
        
        Executing FLORIS
        ================
        Currently, FLORIS can be executed by simply running ``FLORIS.py``:
        
        ``python3 FLORIS.py``
        
        The FLORIS module can also be imported into other projects to extend the current capability.
        
        Future work
        ===========
        - improve the swept area point sampling to consistently include more points
