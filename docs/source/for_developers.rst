For Developers
--------------

FLORIS is currently maintained at NREL's National Wind Technology Center by
`Jen Annoni <mailto:jennifer.annoni@nrel.gov>`_,
`Paul Fleming <mailto:paul.fleming@nrel.gov>`_, and
`Rafael Mudafort <mailto:rafael.mudafort@nrel.gov>`_. However, we are excited about
outside contribution, and this page outlines processes and procedures we'd like to follow
when contributing to the source code.

API Reference
=============
The `FLORIS API documentation <../doxygen/html/index.html>`_ is auto-generated
with Doxygen. It is a work in progress and continuously update, so please feel free to contribute!

Git and GitHub
==============
Coming soon.

Deploying to pip
================
Generally, only NREL developers will have appropriate permissions to deploy FLORIS updates.
When the time comes, here is a great reference on doing it:
