example_0015_open_and_vis_sowfa.py
==================================

SOWFA (https://github.com/NREL/SOWFA) is an NREL LES-code which is used to explore wind farm controls in high-fidelity and compare FLORIS results to.
This repository therefore includes some tools for interacting with SOWFA in a way that standardizes the interface to FLORIS and SOWFA and allows
a commen set of analysis functions to be applied to the outputs of each.  This first example shows an example of visualization of a saved SOWFA
flow-field

Note that an example saved SOWFA run is included with this repository
